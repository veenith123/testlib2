    After eating the boy, the old man met a small dog.
    <br>The small dog asked,"Old man, old man, what makes you so fat ?"
</div>

<div class="para2">
    The old man said, ' I 've taken a very heavy breakfast."
    <br>"What did you take in your breakfast?" asked the dog.
    <br>"Two mugs of tea and two litres of milk" replied the old man.
    <br>"Only this much ?" asked the dog.
    <br>"I've taken three tins of biscuits," replied the old man.
    <br>"Only this much ?" asked the dog.
    <br>"I also ate five big pieces of cakes." replied the old man.
    <br>"Only this much ?" asked the dog.
    <br>"I also ate a small boy", replied the old man.

<div class="para3">
