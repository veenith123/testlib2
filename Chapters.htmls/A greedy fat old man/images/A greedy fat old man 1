Once there lived a greedy fat old man.
One day he got up at 6 a.m. and brushed his teeth at 6.30 a.m.
He took tea at 7 a.m. and breakfast at 8 .30 a.m.
Do you know how much tea he took ? and what did he take in his breakfast ?
He took two mugs of tea and two litres of milk.
 Then he took three tins of biscuit and five big pieces of cakes.
 After breakfast he looked really very very fat.

 Then he went out for a walked and walked till he met a little thin boy.
 He had a long conversation with the boy.





 Old man : Have you brushed your teeth ?
 Boy : No , I don't have 
 Old man : Do  you have enough tea and milk to drink ?
 Boy : No , I don't have 
 Old man : Do  you have enough biscuit to eat ?
 Boy : No , I don't have 
 Old man : do you have enough cake to eat ?
 Boy : No I don't have .


When the old man had just finished his questions , the boy asked him a question.
Boy : Old man , old man , what makes so fat ? 


The old man said , "I've taken two mugs of tea , two litres of milk.
 I also took three tins of biscuit and five kilograms of cakes . 
  And if I can catch you , i'll eat you up .


  Then the old man caught the thin little boy and ate him up.
