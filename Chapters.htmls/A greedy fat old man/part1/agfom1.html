<h1>A GREEDY FAT OLD MAN [PART1]</h1>

<div class="para1">
    Once there lived a greedy fat old man.
    <br>One day he got up at 6 am and brushed his teeth at 6.30 a.m.
    <br>He took tea at 7 a.m. and breakfast at 8.30 am.
    <br>Do you know how much tea he took ? 
    <br>And what did he take in his breakfast ?

    <br>Then he took three tins of biscuit and five big pieces of cakes.
    <br>After breakfast he looked really very very fat.
